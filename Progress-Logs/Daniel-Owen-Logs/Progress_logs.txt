Week 1 (August 25th - September 1st)
- Requested Table and Locker to so we can store and work on the project at the EDC.

- Checked if things still worked from last semester:
  - Recalibrated Sensors (GPS and Compass)
  - Tested Communication with Pi
  
- Troubleshooted Drone motor issue. Issue where the Pixhawk gave an error "Failed to communicate with motors".
  Fixed by recalibrating sensors
- Motors and Pixhawk now ready to arm, but won't turn on/arm. Issue maybe with actual motors (HW). Waiting to get it in lab to test.

- Worked on Integrating Pi and Pixhawk Communication. Currently working through issue trying to run Python code on the Pi to arm the Pixhawk.

- Started Integration with the GUI subsystem. (What information we need to send and how).

- Have an Integration Plan between the drone and the beacon (XBee talking to Raspberry Pi).


Week 2 (September 2nd - September 8th) What I plan to do
- Have been a bit busy this week with career fair

- Continue Troubleshooting
- Continue trying to get a table so we can work on campus easily
- Make presentation for Monday

- Hope to fix motor issue once we get a table and I can do further testing/ask Andrew
- Finish working on Integrating Pi to Pixhawk code, maybe be issue because drone is not arming in general
- Work on Integration with beacon subsystem (writing python code and setting up a test)
- Work on Intrgration with the GUI subsystem (writing and reading python code, sending and recieve waypoint text file, etc.)


Week 3 (September 9th - September 15th)
6 hours
- Found temporary place to store parts and drone on campus
- Performed continuity test on motors and wire connections on the drone
- Found issue with wire splitters that connect the ESCs to the battery
- Resoldered connection to a PDB 
- Performed continuity test as connections were soldered on


Week 4 (September 16th - September 21st or will do)
2 hours so far
- Tested new drone connection set up, still doesn't work...
- Talked with Andrew again and got some ideas to troubleshoot the issue
- Got new ESCs and motors to help with troubleshooting
- Work on second presentation
- continue troubleshooting and help with integrating beacon and PC App
